libraries I collected in my daily working and studying.
 
concurrency,h implemented a Queue using pthread lock semantics.

mysort.h include all kinds of sort algorithm and top N algorithm, namely bfpr algorithm.

mysearch.h is the binary search algorithm.

CSymbolFilter is a prefix filtering class implementation, namely so-called trie.
